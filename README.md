Puerto Rico Sea Level Rise Center - Data Portal Dashboard  In collaboration with PRSTRT and CCRS, this project develops a dashboard to assess and visualize sea level rise risks. Using data analytics and engineering, it offers insights into flood risks in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, supporting resilience and adaptation planning.


Puerto Rico Sea Level Rise Center - Data Portal Dashboard

Project Overview
This dashboard project is a collaborative effort with the Puerto Rico Science, Technology & Research Trust (PRSTRT) and the Caribbean Center for Rising Seas (CCRS). It aims to develop a comprehensive visual tool to assess and address the risks associated with sea level rise in Puerto Rico and the broader Caribbean region. By leveraging advanced data analytics and engineering techniques, the dashboard provides critical insights into flood risks, aiding in resilience and adaptation planning efforts.
